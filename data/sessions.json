You will learn how to customize common practices and tool sets to build a database deployment pipeline unique to your environment, so you can speed up your own database delivery while still protecting your organization's most valuable asset: its data.",

        "description": "Amazon's development philosophy is to automate anything that machines do better than people. While the benefits are obvious, it's not so clear how to achieve this - especially for the database. This talk tells the story-so-far of how an ex-Amazon-led team at A Place for Mom (APFM) has implemented continuous delivery for the database backend of their software. You'll learn about the technical and organisational challenges the team faced and the products and resources they're using to overcome them.",

        "description": "Source control is a way of life for developers â€“ it's a way of sharing code, of protecting our work, and of saving our bacon when things go wrong. So why aren't you using it with your database?\n\nTechnology used to be a major issue for many companies - there were few available solutions, so those that did implement database source control had to cobble together their own systems. That issue has largely been overcome in recent years, with the release of lifecycle tools like Red Gate's SQL Source Control. However, the business challenges remain, and they can be quite intimidating, to say the least.\n\nIn this session, I'll describe some of the challenges I've seen, and we'll discuss how the opportunities that lie beyond make the implementation of source control worthwhile.",

Each project team had their own out-of-sync version of the dev database, and integrating the changes for frequent releases was agonising.\n\nWe'll walk through how we managed to get our databases into source control to painlessly manage changes and deployments â€“ and explain the mistakes we made along the way. You'll learn how to gradually bring your development databases under source control, as well as some of the pitfalls to avoid, and the benefits both in development and deployment.\n\n<strong>Learning outcomes:</strong>\n\nThe steps and tools for implementing database source control and rolling it out across your organisation.\n\nHow you can achieve a reliable and consistent version of your database that can be installed in minutes.\n\nHow using the right tools can achieve an increase in confidence in the code being deployed.\n\nHow to demonstrate the improved time between development and deployment, not least in the time required in QA.",

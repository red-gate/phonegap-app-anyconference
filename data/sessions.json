And like a wedding, there's magic when it goes right. Yet, when it goes wrong, it goes really wrong. You're not required to wear tails or a wedding hat. However, whether you write code, manage a database, lead a team - or even all those things - you'll want to come to this session and grab insight into how you can take your team to the next level to deliver great solutions with less stress.",

        "description": "Move With Us' legacy database is a dragon of a system, spitting fire at every opportunity, and causing pain with every deployment. This talk describes Move With Us' roll-out of an automated database release process and how it's dramatically improving the reliability of deployments, and freeing up time for critical tasks such as refactoring the legacy database.\n\nYou'll learn how the team overcame technical challenges, and how this project is fuelling the aspirations of everyone involved, creating a close-knit band of heroic dragon-slayers in the process.\n\n<strong>Learning outcomes:<strong>\n\nThe necessary steps and tools to move from a manual, day-long build-and-deploy process, to an automated one that takes a matter of minutes, and the benefits Move With Us has seen as a result.\n\nThe steps you can take to dramatically improve communication with business owners. How we can trace specific schema changes back to the developer, the build, dates, and tickets, and how database updates can be shipped to any environment, safely and on demand.\n\nThe positive impact this process has had on team morale and motivation, and how a philosophy of agile continuous improvement is as relevant to people as it is to software.",

Each project team had their own out-of-sync version of the dev database, and integrating the changes for frequent releases was agonising.\n\nWe'll walk through how we managed to get our databases into source control to painlessly manage changes and deployments – and explain the mistakes we made along the way. You'll learn how to gradually bring your development databases under source control, as well as some of the pitfalls to avoid, and the benefits both in development and deployment.\n\n<strong>Learning outcomes:</strong>\n\nThe steps and tools for implementing database source control and rolling it out across your organisation.\n\nHow you can achieve a reliable and consistent version of your database that can be installed in minutes.\n\nHow using the right tools can achieve an increase in confidence in the code being deployed.\n\nHow to demonstrate the improved time between development and deployment, not least in the time required in QA.",
